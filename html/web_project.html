            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>The objective of our website is to allow travelers to record their
                customized travel plans, plus a collection of different types of websites, such as
                specialized hotel booking sites, transportation booking sites, and local weather
                forecasting sites. In addition, we also wanted to allow travelers to share their
                trips and view others' travel experiences, so we added a public user blog feature
                as well.</p>
            <img src="../img/flowchart.png">
            
            <h1>Languages and Framework</h1>
            <p>We applied Flask, which is one of the web programming
                frameworks written in Python, to write code for different functions on our website.
                We chose SQLite as the database to store users' information. Apart from
                that, we also applied HTML to display these functions on a web browser and
                CSS to adjust the layout and improve the presentation of our website.</p>
            
            <h1>Website Component</h1>
            <h2>Login/register</h2>
            <p>To better manage the information of different users, we designed
                login and registration pages. When entering our website, users will be
                required to first register an account or log in to their account. To realize these
                functions, we create a table that is composed of five columns in the database.</p>
            <h2>Create/view travel plans</h2>
            <p>After finishing logging in, users will enter the homepage.
                By clicking the "create a new plan" button, they will be directed to a page
                where they can enter their origin, start date, end date, and travel plans. We
                created another table to store this information.</p>
            <h2>Create/view travel blogs</h2>
            <p>By clicking the "create a new blog" button, users will be directed to a page where
                they can enter the title and content of the blog.We created another table to store
                this information. After clicking "save", they will go back to the homepage. To
                view all the blogs, users can click the "view plans" button.</p>
            <h2>Other functions</h2>
            <p>We applied the idea of building a navigation on our website
                and created a web page that collects some other travel-related websites. By
                clicking the hyperlinks shown on this web page, users can visit other websites to
                book tickets or hotels.</p>
